              i want to take the bits of you i love and press them like flowers between the pages of my favorite book
              and i want to take all the scraps that you dislike in yourself and display them on my refrigerator to show you i'm still proud of the person
              you are and the person you are becoming
              but most of all, i want to spin you like a globe and drag my finger across till it stops to discover the pieces

            </p>

            <p>
              of you that you've yet to reveal to anyone else
              i want to wrap them up in linen and place them in an old cigar box, i'd tuck it away safely in the top drawer of
              my bedside table, so you know i'll never let those pieces of you go
              because when you share hidden parts of yourself with someone else, you're trusting that person to
              hold the secret sections of your heart and to love the bits you thought were unlovable

            <p>I wish I could explain how wonderful you are. How I could look into your eyes and never get tired of their beauty. 
              How the sound of your voice gives me butterflies. How seeing you walk into a room makes me smile. 
              How much you mean to me. And how much I love you
              But you have me at a loss for words. And even if I could find the words to tell you these things, 
              it wouldn't come anywhere near to showing how much you mean to me.</p>
